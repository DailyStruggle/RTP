# Potential Bugs Backlog

A queue of incidental discoveries — suspected bugs, latent races, missing validations, stale comments — that were spotted while working on an **unrelated** task and deliberately **not** fixed in-line, per the *Stay-On-Task Policy* in [`.junie/AGENTS.md`](../../.junie/AGENTS.md).

This file is a backlog, not a tracker. Promote an entry to a real issue (or fold it into a future task's `Effective Issue`) when it is ready to be worked on. Strike entries through (`~~…~~`) or remove them once resolved.

## How to add an entry

Append to the *Open* section below using the template. Keep entries short — one paragraph each. If a deeper analysis is warranted, link to a separate doc rather than inlining it here.

### Template

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

- **Discovered during:** <issue ref / short task description>
- **Location:** `<path/to/File.java>` line <N> (or symbol name)
- **Symptom / hypothesis:** <one or two sentences>
- **Impact:** <user-visible effect, best guess>
- **Suggested next step:** <minimal investigation or fix sketch>
```

## Open

<!-- Append new entries above this comment, newest first. -->

## Resolved
